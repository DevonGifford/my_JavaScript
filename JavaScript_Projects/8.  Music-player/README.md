# Animated Navigation 

## Thoughts

The main goal of this project was to create a music player interface where a user can play, pause, skip, rewind, and scrub through a song.

Keeping it simple and to the point.  Not intended to be a spotify clone or anything fancy.
A Lot more functionality could be added  (i.e. Volume Bar, Playlist's, skip ahead etc. )

That being said I found it tricky to implement the live tracking/progress updates of the song.
