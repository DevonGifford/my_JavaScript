# Animated Navigation - in progress...

The main goal of this project was to create a music player interface where a user can play, pause, skip, rewind, and scrub through a song.

Keeping it simple and to the point.  Not intended to be a spotify clone.
Alot more functionality could be added  (i.e. Volume Bar, Playlist's, rewind 5 seconds)
