# Bookmark app

## Thoughts

The main goal of this project was to create a website where you can save and bookmark websites. 
<br>
While I didn't spend too much time on this app as I didn't see much real use cases for this little project, or atleast not in this form.
<br>
That being said I did find it interesting to use JavaScript to createElements that canbe rendered.
As well as using and accessing local storage and creating some basic form validation.
