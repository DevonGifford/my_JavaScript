## Thoughts

This project showcases a simple Kanban board, designed as a productivity tool for managing tasks. As a passionate advocate for Kanban and productivity tools, I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project.
<br>
The goal of this project was to create a user-friendly Kanban board with drag and drop functionality. It offers a streamlined interface for organizing tasks and visualizing their progress across different stages.
<br><br>
While this project provided a solid foundation for a Kanban board, I have decided to conclude its development at this stage. I have successfully implemented the core functionalities and gained a deep understanding of creating a 'drag and drop' experience.
<br>
While there is potential for expanding this project into a fully-fledged Trello-like productivity app, I have made the decision to focus my efforts on learning new technologies. However, I may revisit this project in the future and leverage React Native to develop a mobile app version.
