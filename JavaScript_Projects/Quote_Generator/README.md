# Thoughts

I had previously created a random quote generator back when I was doing the [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) curriculum. 
However when I made that random quote generator, I didn't use an API.   I used a 2 dimentional array with stoic quotes from the former Roman emperor - Marcus Aurelius

In this rendition I used an [API](https://type.fit/api/quotes) with capabilites to tweet the quote.
