- Realistic ball movement: Experience realistic ball physics with smooth and fluid motion.
- Simple controls: Use the mouse or touch input to control the paddles, making it easy for players of all ages to jump in and start playing.

## Potential Uses

I believe this game could serve as a fantastic addition to websites where users may have to wait for a large download or rendering process. It offers a fun and engaging activity to keep users entertained during those brief intervals, creating a positive user experience.

I found this project to be both enjoyable and educational. It allowed me to sharpen my JavaScript skills while exploring the intricacies of game development. I am proud of the outcome and believe that it showcases my ability to create interactive and engaging web applications.
