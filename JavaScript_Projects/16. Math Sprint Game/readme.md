# Math Sprint Game

## Thoughts

The Math Quiz Game is a simple web application that tests your math skills in an interactive and engaging way. Each page of the game dynamically displays different math problems, providing a seamless user experience.

In this project, I adopted a unique approach to page management. Rather than using separate .html files for each page, I utilized multiple div elements that can be turned on or off based on the content to be displayed. This approach allows for better organization and enhanced interactivity.

While this project focuses on basic math problems, I have a vision of creating similar yet more advanced games tailored to specific interview topics. For instance, I aspire to develop games that cover topics like React, space and time complexities, and more. These games can serve as valuable tools for candidates preparing for technical interviews.

## Thoughts

This project brought me back to elementary school. I rememebr those tests where we had I think like, 2 minutes to solve as many math problems as we could. Basically, this project is the same thing, but it just checks how fast you can do the math problems instead of ending at a certain time.

It was pretty neat for this project how each page works. Usually, I think of pages as their own .html files, but this one just has multiple different divs that get turned on or off depeneding on what needs to be shown.
