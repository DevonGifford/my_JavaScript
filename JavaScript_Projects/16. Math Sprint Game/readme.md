## Thoughts

The Math Quiz Game is a simple web application that tests your math skills in an interactive and engaging way. Each page of the game dynamically displays different math problems, providing a seamless user experience.
<br>
In this project, I adopted a unique approach to page management. Rather than using separate .html files for each page, I utilized multiple div elements that can be turned on or off based on the content to be displayed. This approach allows for better organization and enhanced interactivity.
<br><br>
While this project focuses on basic math problems, I have a vision of creating similar yet more advanced games tailored to specific interview topics. For instance, I aspire to develop games that cover topics like React, space and time complexities, and more. These games can serve as valuable tools for candidates preparing for technical interviews.
