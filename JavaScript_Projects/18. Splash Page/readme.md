## Thoughts

This project taught me the value of using design tools like Figma. By creating the visual styles and layouts in Figma beforehand, the CSS for this project came together quickly and efficiently.
<br/>
While JavaScript played a minor role in this project, the main takeaway for me was the power of incorporating design planning into my development workflow. Moving forward, I plan to utilize tools like Figma to plan and visualize my projects before diving into the code.
<br/><br/>
The primary focus of this website was to showcase various styling techniques and backgrounds. By exploring different CSS properties and experimenting with unique visual elements, I aimed to create engaging and visually appealing web experiences.
<br/>
I look forward to further leveraging my newfound knowledge of Figma and applying it to future projects, where I can create seamless collaborations between design and development, resulting in more polished and efficient outcomes.
