This is great if you like 'dad-jokes' in a programming format.

## Thoughts

While this was an interesting little project and was nice to learn a little more about incorporating a text-to-speech aspect to the app - again simpler than what I thought it would be.
I decided to keep it simple for the sake of functionality by just calling on an API that will output our joke in TTS. 
Also using a switch statement over an if-else conditional was fun.
