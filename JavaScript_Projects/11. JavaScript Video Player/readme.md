# JavaScript Videoplayer

## Thoughts

The main goal of this project was to create a website with basic video playback capabilites 
<br><br>
<strong>Functionality includes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>play and pause
<li>volume & mute, 
<li>playback speed 
<li>fullscreen functionality
</ul>
<br>
That being said I can see how this project will be helpful in one day creating a youtube or netlflix clone one day into the future.
