## Thoughts

<hr>

This project is a simple implementation of the popular game Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock. The game includes an interactive interface where the user can select their choice, play against the computer, and see the results.

### Introduction

The main objective of this project was to create a fun and interactive game using JavaScript. The game extends the traditional Rock Paper Scissors game by adding two additional choices: Lizard and Spock. The most challenging part of the project was determining the rules for the new choices and implementing the game logic accordingly.

Additionally, the project features a confetti effect using the `confetti.js` library, which adds a delightful visual element to the game.

### Features

- Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock gameplay: Players can select their choice and play against the computer.
- Confetti animation: The game includes a confetti effect to celebrate winning rounds.
- Random computer choice: The computer randomly selects its choice for each round.
- Score tracking: The scores of both the player and the computer are displayed, updating in real-time as the game progresses.

### Conclusion

Creating the Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game was an enjoyable and educational experience. It allowed me to practice JavaScript logic and user interaction while implementing a fun and popular game variant. I hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I enjoyed building it!
