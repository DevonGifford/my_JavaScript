An incredibly simple project, the most challenging part was figuring out what does lizard and spock beat and lose too.<br>I did like how we used a Javascript to create the confetti effect using modules.<br>

I don't know about you but the 'computer' keep beating me - it's really just selecting at random but still beats me.😅
