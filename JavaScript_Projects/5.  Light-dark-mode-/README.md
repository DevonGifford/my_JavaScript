# Picture in Picture

The main goal of this project was to create a website that can toggle between light and dark themes.  It also features localHost so the user's preference is saved and will be defaulted to the appropriate them when the user returns.

## Thoughts

While I have always been interested in learning how to implement a dark-mode toggle as I am an avid dark mode user, to the point where I will click off a website without a dark mode.  (not really but kind of yes really)

It was also exciting to learn how to implement localHost to save our users preference.

While I could have done more to make the website be more interesting, I decided against it as this was simple practice for implementing a toggle for light/dark mode.
