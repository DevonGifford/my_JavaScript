# Calculator Website

## Thoughts

This project holds a special place in my heart as it allowed me to overcome a challenge I faced back in high school. In those days, I took a Java programming course, and building a calculator was the very reason I dropped out. However, I now realize that my younger self was simply inexperienced, and with newfound knowledge and determination, I have successfully built this calculator website.

<br/><br/>

The Calculator Website is a simple yet powerful tool that allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations. While the current version offers standard calculator functionality, there is immense potential for future enhancements.
<br/>
Creating this calculator website was a highly rewarding experience. It served as a vindication of my growth as a developer, overcoming a challenge that had once deterred me. With a solid foundation in place, I can now explore new features and possibilities for this project.

<br/><br/>

Although this project is simple in its current state, there are several exciting features that could be added to enhance its functionality and user experience. Some ideas for future improvements include:

<li>Customizable themes: Allow users to choose from different themes or color schemes to personalize the appearance of the calculator.

<li>Advanced mathematical functions: Implement support for trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent), logarithms, exponentiation, square roots, and more.

<li>Unit conversions: Include functionality to convert between different units, such as length, weight, temperature, and currency.

<li>Memory functions: Add buttons to store and recall values from memory, allowing users to perform calculations with stored values.

<li>History log: Implement a history log to keep track of past calculations and allow users to review or reuse them.

<li>Fraction and decimal support: Enable the calculator to handle fractions and decimals, providing precise results for more complex calculations.

<li>Accessibility features: Implement accessibility enhancements, such as support for screen readers and keyboard navigation, to ensure the calculator is inclusive and usable by all users.
