## Thoughts

Fun little project using an API from NASA.  
<br><br>
This project is a simple webpage that fetches the Picture of the Day from the NASA API and displays it along with some information about the image. Users can also save their favorite images and remove them from the favorites list.
<br><br>
I chose note to spend much more time on this project even though I really like the idea, I want to move onto something more challenging. 

### Features
