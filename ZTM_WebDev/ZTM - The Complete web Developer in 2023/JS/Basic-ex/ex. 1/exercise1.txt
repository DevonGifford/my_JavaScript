//Evaluate the below:
5 + "34" 
534

5 - "4"
1 (will think that 4 was supposed to be an int)

10 % 5
0 - no remainders 

5 % 10
5 (this is becaause there was 0.5 left over)

"Java" + "Script"
Javascript

" " + " "
"    "

" " + 0
"  0"  (will think the 0 was a string)

true + true
2

true + false
will be 1 as true counts as a true

false + true
1 - same as above

false - true
-1 

3 - 4
-1

"Bob" - "bill"
NaN - (Not a Number)

//Evaluate the below comparisons:
5 >= 1
true

0 === 1
false

4 <= 1
false

1 != 1
false

"A" > "B"
false

"B" < "C"
true

"a" > "A"
true

"b" < "A"
true

true === false
false

true != true
false

// Make the string: "Hi There! It's "sunny" out" by using the + sign:
"Hi there!  It\'s \"sunny\" outside"
